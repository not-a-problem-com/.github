## About Us

Welcome to **Not-A-Problem** ‚Äî your documentation playground:

- Part tech blog, part comedy of errors.
- A place to over-explain the obvious.
- And sometimes, a way to write down the obscure ‚Äúnon-problems‚Äù that somehow took three hours of Googling to figure out.

Think of it as a troubleshooting guide for the over-thinker, the perfectionist, or anyone who‚Äôs ever reinstalled an OS just because the desktop icons looked at them funny.

This blog doesn‚Äôt promise efficiency. It doesn‚Äôt even promise relevance. What it does promise is an archive of fixes, tweaks, and questionable decisions ‚Äî carefully recorded so you don‚Äôt have to waste time wondering why on earth someone did that.

Because sometimes the only thing more satisfying than fixing what‚Äôs broken‚Ä¶ is fixing what isn‚Äôt.
